# MyEV: EV Charger Finder Mobile Application

MyEV is a mobile application designed to help electric vehicle (EV) drivers find charging stations. With EVs' increasing popularity, it is becoming more important to have easy access to charging facilities. MyEV aims to make this process simple and convenient by providing a user-friendly interface that allows drivers to locate nearby charging stations quickly.

The application uses location-based services to identify the nearest charging stations and displays them on a map. Drivers can also filter their search based on the type of charging station they require, such as fast or slow charging, and view additional information, such as availability and pricing.

MyEV has been developed as part of my final year project, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement. I have put a lot of effort into the coding, and I hope it will be useful to EV drivers looking for a reliable and efficient way to locate charging stations.
